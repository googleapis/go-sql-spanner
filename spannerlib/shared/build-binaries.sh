# Builds the shared library binaries and copies the binaries to OS/arch specific folders.
# Binaries can be built for linux/x64, darwin/arm64, and windows/x64.
# Which ones are actually built depends on the values of the following variables:
# SKIP_MACOS: If set, will skip the darwin/arm64 build
# SKIP_LINUX: If set, will skip the linux/x64 build that uses the default C compiler on the system
# SKIP_LINUX_CROSS_COMPILE: If set, will skip the linux/x64 build that uses the x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc C compiler.
#                           This compiler is used when compiling for linux/x64 on MacOS.
# SKIP_WINDOWS: If set, will skip the windows/x64 build.

# The binaries are stored in the following files:
# binaries/osx-arm64/spannerlib.dylib
# binaries/linux-x64/spannerlib.so
# binaries/win-x64/spannerlib.dll
